Get Started:

Fork and clone the repo.

Run `npm install` for all dependencies.

Run `npm run start` and the expo client should spin up the metro bundler.

Download the expo client app on your phone to test it on your phone or just run it in the browser through the metro bundler.

Currently all data is being sent to the deployed heroku server that has its own PostreSQL database, but you may run a local dev server with the script `npm run dev` and link it to your own database.
